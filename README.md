Bayesian Analysis & Inference
Project under Stamatics, IIT Kanpur
Project Area : Probabilistic Modelling
Description : “Dive into the world of probabilistic thinking! This project will uncover the secrets of probability and statistics, through programming. We’ll begin by exploring the fundamentals of Bayesian statistics, a framework that incorporates prior knowledge, and see how it unlocks new possibilities in data analysis.
We’ll then delve into probabilistic programming, a revolutionary approach that lets you code with probability itself! Using cutting-edge libraries like PyMC and ArviZ, we’ll build sophisticated hierarchical models that capture complex relationships within your data. Additionally, we’ll re-visit familiar machine learning models like Linear Regression and Regression Trees from a fresh perspective, viewing them through the lens of probability.”
